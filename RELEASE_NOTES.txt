Known Bugs
- When adding or modifying a new question, two duplicate choices can be added and no error is thrown
- When adding a new question, there is no limit on the length of the choice text

Assumptions 
- Only one teacher will be logged into the same account at the same time
    - If multiple people are logged into the same account, and one person logs out, this will cause the other person to be automatically logged out (which may seem weird to the user)
    - Therefore, the assumption is that only one person is logged into one account at a time, although we have error handling if this is not the case
- Teacher will give class code to students to make their student accounts
    - A teacher account will not have any student data unless there are students who make account with the teacher's class code
- An external API will be used for the backend
    - If the backend API needs to be changed, then the link in config.js, as well as the deployment environment, must be updated

Limitations
- Ad-block must be turned off for the log-in and log-out requests due to the way we perform authentication on the backend
- In order to stub requests with Cypress for testing, HTTP request must be XHR requests (Cypress is currently working on expanding functionality to stub other kinds of requests, but this is still experimental)
